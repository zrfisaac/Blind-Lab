[//]: # (# - introduction)
## Introduction

This Blind Lab is an open-source project created using the Godot game engine. It features a unique inclusive game concept, designed to be accessible for blind players. The game is a science fiction adventure that doesn't rely on visual elements, allowing blind individuals to fully participate and enjoy the experience.

## Credits

To ensure accessibility, the game utilizes the Free Text-To-Speech and Text-to-MP3 for US English tool available at https://ttsmp3.com. This online tool enables text-based content to be converted into spoken audio, providing blind players with auditory cues and instructions throughout the game.
